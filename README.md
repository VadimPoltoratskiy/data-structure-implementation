# data-structure-implementation

You have to implement your own collection which will have next characteristics:

1. Behaviour like deque.
2. Method for removing multiple entries from index to index.
3. Method removeIf which will take 3 arguments: condition (elements count), index for start removing, count of elemnts for removing. 
4. Method sort.
5. Method distinct.

Implements and Extends doesn't work for this task, using of existing collections does not work for this task.
